hello! this is a readme
hi 
hi!!

10/15/20 sathvika: Ok so i uploaded prelim_kmeans which is just super cluttered kmeans 
code along with loading some sample data and running some sample pca 
(just to see if the kmeans code actually works) ( and it does woo). 
And then I tried to make it look better and more useful and pretty by making it into a class, 
which is the kmeans.py class. however i suck at python and dont know the syntax 
for classes so it is not done! Im still working on it :)

10/16/20 alec: okay so since the ImPCA class is huge i'll add some documentation in a text file later for any one who wants to mess around with it. also i just added a couple more functions to it that do some cool stuff, and some that do some useless stuff. anyway
