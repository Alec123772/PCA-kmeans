hi!!

10/15/20 sathvika: Ok so i uploaded prelim_kmeans which is just super cluttered kmeans code along with loading some sample data and running some sample pca (just to see if the kmeans code actually works) ( and it does woo). And then I tried to make it look better and more useful and pretty by making it into a class, which is the kmeans.py class. however i suck at python and dont know the syntax for classes so it is not done! Im still working on it :)
